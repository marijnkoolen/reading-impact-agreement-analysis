    "#### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- For some sentences, all or most annotators agree that the sentence is uninterpretable, therefore, that the questions are unanswerable. \n",
    "    - Of these sentences, some are indeed hard to interpret. That is, it could be that the sentence expresses some form of reading impact, but you probably need to see the preceding sentences in the review to figure that out. So you can't say there is no impact, but neither can you say that there is. Some examples:\n",
    "        - _also check marriage and birth certificates after reading joelle's diaries \\\\ no follow up with boyfriend \\\\ possibility of fingerprints on finger bandage \\\\ buy a horse?_\n",
    "        - _Yes, I already know this and live it._\n",
    "        - _I acknowledge my own place in a broken system and my duty to help give others the tools to educate themselves and others through reliable sources._\n",
    "        - _:)_\n",
    "    - Others seems to be descriptive sentences, i.e. describing some aspect of the story. Here the unanswerable annotation seem to express that there is no impact. Some examples:\n",
    "        - _She responds with \"Okay daddy._\n",
    "        - _She goes to Omega Point and Kenji suddenly appears_\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The `unanswerable` annotations seem to be a mixed bag of interpretations, with examples that are genuinely uninterpretable, others where annotators seem to signal _no impact_ instead. However, it is difficult to determine if an annotator intended `no_impact` or actually considered the sentence to be uninterpretable. \n",

    "- The annotators who do more than 10 sentences, use `no_impact` more often than `unanswerable`. The `no_impact` option translates to a score of 0 for all impact scales.\n",
    "    - Some annotators seem to use the `unanswerable` option for both uninterpretable sentences and sentences that express no reading impact. E.g. annotators _vlh718_ and _nhf461_ never use `no_impact` and only use `unanswerable`.\n",
    "    - Vice versa, some seem to only use `no_impact`, e.g. _ovk109_ and _lbp656_. It is possible that they feel comfortable interpreting the review author's intention without any further context. Given that `no_impact` is more common than `unanswerable`, it is also possible that annotators who only use `no_impact` only encountered sentences they felt confident about interpreting.\n",
    "- There are big differences in rating behaviour when annotators do assign ratings. \n",
    "    - Some tend to rate 'all or nothing' with the majority of ratings being 0, 3 or 4, e.g. _war861_, _hgx670_, _vlh718_ and _bct067_.\n",
    "    - Others tend to avoid very high ratings, e.g. _nhf461_, _dpn657_ and _vbp813_ rarely use score 4.\n",
    "    - Yet others tend to pick central values, e.g. _ifw202_ and _gry278_ rarely score 0 or 4, and 2 more often than 1 and 3. \n",
    "    \n",
    "These observations together suggest that individual annotator differ strongly in how they interpreted the answer options and rating scale. This further suggests that either annotator's responses need to debiased or that annotators need to be instructed and trained before starting the actual annotation task."

    "One way to investigate this is to filter annotations by removing those contributed by annotators who make fewer than 10 or 20 annotations. A consequence of leaving out annotations is that for some sentences, there will be fewer than three judgements.

    "\n",
    "Above we saw that some impact categories rarely occur, which creates a big class imbalance. That is, the annotators indicate that the vast majority of sentences express no _humor impact_. Therefore, it is inevitable that they agree on a large number of sentences where no _humor impact_ is expressed. The inter-rater agreement measure $r_{wg}$ will therefore reflect high agreement, while it is possible that annotator sitll largely disagree about which sentences _do_ express _humor impact_. A measure that better handles these types of class or category imbalances is **Fleiss' Kappa** (a version of Cohen's Kappa for cases with more than 2 annotators)."

    "For many annotation tasks, there are learning effects, in that annotators develop their understanding of the task and how to interpret the various categories they need to annotate. It is possible that as annotators annotate more sentences, they become more consistent in their annotations, and converge to more similar interpretations of the annotation categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we look at the agreement among annotators in different subsets of the annotators. We compare the agreement among three groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All**: All annotators: This includes annotators who stopped after one or a handful of sentences.\n",
    "- **10**: Annotators who annotated at least a full batch of 10 sentences: these annotators perserved through at least a full batch, so have had more chance of coming across multiple sentences that express a certain impact category, but in different ways or with a different degree.\n",
    "- **>10**: Annotators who annotated at more than a full batch of 10 sentences, were willing to do more, so may have perceived this as a task they understood and enjoyed enough to continue with a new batch. The frequency distribution at the top of this notebook shows that annotators who did more than 10 sentences all did at least 18 sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact of Binarisation\n",
    "\n",
    "We also look at the affect on agreement of using the full rating scale versus different binarisations, where the scale is reduced to either zero or one. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **>=1**: a binarisation of $r_{b} = 1 \\leftarrow r >=1$ where any rating above zero is mapped to $1$, as it is a signal that a category is present, or \n",
    "- **>=3**: a binarisation of $r_{b} = 1 \\leftarrow r >=3$ where any rating of 3 or 4 is mapped to $1$. This binarisation means only when the annotator thought the impact category is clearly present, is it counted as presence of that category. \n",
